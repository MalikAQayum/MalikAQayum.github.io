				<h2>
					Live Stat page
				</h2>
				<p>
					We have a few things happening on the Live Stats page.
					<br><br>1. latest received Curator package, appears when the scripts see we have received a new appid, otherwise it stays hidden.
					<br>2. Page reloads all the data ever nth second. the progressbar shows how long until next reload.
					<br>3. Then we have a bit of data, such as;
					<br><p>-Total Copies (how many copies we have available in total from all the pending/excluded appids we have available.)
					<br>-Total Appids (how many unique pending/excluded appids we have available to claim.)
					<br>-Pending (how many pending appids we have available.)
					<br>-Excluded (how many excluded appids we have available.)
					<br>-Accepted (I will get into this later, as it is a bit different than the other data available.)
					</p><br>4. A visual bar chart to show the above data.
					<br>5. personal stat, that shows how many curator packages you have claimed in your "lifetime" throughtout all the Curators you have been a part of.

					Steam Store app page

				<p>
					We are checking our main curator that we have defined in the script for now, whether or not we have that package available.
					<br>
					<br>1. Coming Soon apps will have a "Add through Curator" button.
					<br>2. Released apps will have a "Add through Curator" button.
					<br> (For now the button just directs us to the pending page of the curator, this could be changed so it just claims it instead, if people want that.)
